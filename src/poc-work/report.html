<p>The table above presents the estimated monthly interest and dividend income and return of principal that your current holdings may generate over the next rolling 12 months. 
The cash flows displayed are estimates provided for informational purposes only and there is no guarantee that you will actually receive any of the amounts displayed. These 
estimates should not be relied upon for making investment, trading or tax decisions. The estimates for fixed rate domestic bond and CD income are calculated using the  
security's coupon rate. The estimates for domestic common stock and mutual fund income are calculated using an indicated annual dividend (IAD). The IAD is an estimate of a 
security's dividend payments for the next 12 months calculated based on prior and/or declared dividends for that security. IADs are sourced from third party vendors believed to 
be reliable, but no assurance can be made as to accuracy. There are circumstances in which these estimates will not be presented for a specific security you hold.  
Please refer to the Help/Glossary section of Fidelity.com for additional information on these calculations.
Bond &amp; CD Income includes interest payments for fixed rate bonds and Certificates of Deposit (CDs). 
Bond &amp; CD Principal includes maturing principal payments for CDs and the following bonds: fixed rate, floating rate, variable rate, discount,and zero coupon. 
Stock Income includes estimated dividend payments for common stock, ADR's, and REITs. 
Mutual Fund Income includes estimated dividend payments for Fidelity and non-Fidelity mutual funds.
The table above does not include cash flow from the following securities: preferred stocks, international stocks, exchange trade products (ETF's &amp; ETN's), UITs, variable 
rate bonds, and international bonds, but may be included in future enhancements.

<p>The table above presents the estimated monthly interest and dividend income and return of principal that your current holdings may generate over the next rolling 12 months. 
The cash flows displayed are estimates provided for informational purposes only and there is no guarantee that you will actually receive any of the amounts displayed. These 
estimates should not be relied upon for making investment, trading or tax decisions. The estimates for fixed rate domestic bond and CD income are calculated using the  
security's coupon rate. The estimates for domestic common stock and mutual fund income are calculated using an indicated annual dividend (IAD). The IAD is an estimate of a 
security's dividend payments for the next 12 months calculated based on prior and/or declared dividends for that security. IADs are sourced from third party vendors believed to 
be reliable, but no assurance can be made as to accuracy. There are circumstances in which these estimates will not be presented for a specific security you hold.  
Please refer to the Help/Glossary section of Fidelity.com for additional information on these calculations.
Bond &amp; CD Income includes interest payments for fixed rate bonds and Certificates of Deposit (CDs). 
Bond &amp; CD Principal includes maturing principal payments for CDs and the following bonds: fixed rate, floating rate, variable rate, discount,and zero coupon. 
Stock Income includes estimated dividend payments for common stock, ADR's, and REITs. 
Mutual Fund Income includes estimated dividend payments for Fidelity and non-Fidelity mutual funds.
The table above does not include cash flow from the following securities: preferred stocks, international stocks, exchange trade products (ETF's &amp; ETN's), UITs, variable 
rate bonds, and international bonds, but may be included in future enhancements.

<p>The table above presents the estimated monthly interest and dividend income and return of principal that your current holdings may generate over the next rolling 12 months. 
The cash flows displayed are estimates provided for informational purposes only and there is no guarantee that you will actually receive any of the amounts displayed. These 
estimates should not be relied upon for making investment, trading or tax decisions. The estimates for fixed rate domestic bond and CD income are calculated using the  
security's coupon rate. The estimates for domestic common stock and mutual fund income are calculated using an indicated annual dividend (IAD). The IAD is an estimate of a 
security's dividend payments for the next 12 months calculated based on prior and/or declared dividends for that security. IADs are sourced from third party vendors believed to 
be reliable, but no assurance can be made as to accuracy. There are circumstances in which these estimates will not be presented for a specific security you hold.  
Please refer to the Help/Glossary section of Fidelity.com for additional information on these calculations.
Bond &amp; CD Income includes interest payments for fixed rate bonds and Certificates of Deposit (CDs). 
Bond &amp; CD Principal includes maturing principal payments for CDs and the following bonds: fixed rate, floating rate, variable rate, discount,and zero coupon. 
Stock Income includes estimated dividend payments for common stock, ADR's, and REITs. 
Mutual Fund Income includes estimated dividend payments for Fidelity and non-Fidelity mutual funds.
The table above does not include cash flow from the following securities: preferred stocks, international stocks, exchange trade products (ETF's &amp; ETN's), UITs, variable 
rate bonds, and international bonds, but may be included in future enhancements.

<p>The table above presents the estimated monthly interest and dividend income and return of principal that your current holdings may generate over the next rolling 12 months. 
The cash flows displayed are estimates provided for informational purposes only and there is no guarantee that you will actually receive any of the amounts displayed. These 
estimates should not be relied upon for making investment, trading or tax decisions. The estimates for fixed rate domestic bond and CD income are calculated using the  
security's coupon rate. The estimates for domestic common stock and mutual fund income are calculated using an indicated annual dividend (IAD). The IAD is an estimate of a 
security's dividend payments for the next 12 months calculated based on prior and/or declared dividends for that security. IADs are sourced from third party vendors believed to 
be reliable, but no assurance can be made as to accuracy. There are circumstances in which these estimates will not be presented for a specific security you hold.  
Please refer to the Help/Glossary section of Fidelity.com for additional information on these calculations.
Bond &amp; CD Income includes interest payments for fixed rate bonds and Certificates of Deposit (CDs). 
Bond &amp; CD Principal includes maturing principal payments for CDs and the following bonds: fixed rate, floating rate, variable rate, discount,and zero coupon. 
Stock Income includes estimated dividend payments for common stock, ADR's, and REITs. 
Mutual Fund Income includes estimated dividend payments for Fidelity and non-Fidelity mutual funds.
The table above does not include cash flow from the following securities: preferred stocks, international stocks, exchange trade products (ETF's &amp; ETN's), UITs, variable 
rate bonds, and international bonds, but may be included in future enhancements.
